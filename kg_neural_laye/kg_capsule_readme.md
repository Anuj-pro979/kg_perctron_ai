> **A revolutionary PyTorch module that combines neural networks with dynamic knowledge graphs, creating intelligent AI systems that learn, reason, and grow.**

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

### **Our Vision**
To create AI systems that don't just process information—they **understand, remember, and reason** like human intelligence. KG Capsule bridges the gap between:
- **Neural Networks** (pattern recognition & learning)  
- **Symbolic AI** (structured knowledge & reasoning)
- **Dynamic Memory** (growing intelligence over time)

### **The Problem We Solve**
Traditional transformers are powerful but limited:
- ❌ **Static Knowledge**: Can't learn new facts after training
- ❌ **No Reasoning**: Process text but don't truly understand connections
- ❌ **Memory Issues**: Forget context, can't build on previous interactions
- ❌ **Black Box**: No interpretable knowledge representation

### **Our Solution: KG Capsule**
A **plug-and-play neural module** that gives any transformer:
- ✅ **Dynamic Learning**: Continuously grows knowledge from interactions
- ✅ **Symbolic Reasoning**: Understands relationships between concepts  
- ✅ **Persistent Memory**: Remembers and builds on past experiences
- ✅ **Interpretability**: Clear knowledge graph you can inspect and modify

## 🚀 What Makes KG Capsule Special?

### **🧠 Hybrid Intelligence Architecture**
```
Traditional Transformer:           KG Capsule Enhanced:
Input → Encoder → Decoder          Input → Encoder → 🧠 KG Capsule → Decoder
     (Static Processing)                        (Dynamic Knowledge)
```

### **⚡ Key Innovations**
1. **Neural-Symbolic Fusion**: Combines learnable embeddings with graph structure
2. **Dynamic Growth**: Automatically creates new knowledge nodes and connections
3. **Bundle Activation**: Propagates reasoning through related concepts
4. **Confidence Tracking**: Knows when it's certain vs. uncertain
5. **GPU Optimized**: Production-ready performance (22ms latency)

    C --> D[Bundle Activation]
    D --> E[Neural Reasoning]

    B -.-> J[(Knowledge Graph)]
    I -.-> J
    J --> K[Nodes: Concepts]
    J --> L[Edges: Relations]
    J --> M[Bundles: Topics]
```

### **Algorithm Steps Explained**

#### 📊 **Stage 1: Knowledge Retrieval**
```python
# Convert input to query representation
query = query_transform(input_vector)  # [batch, dim]

# Find most similar knowledge nodes
similarity = query @ active_embeddings.T  # [batch, nodes]
top_k_nodes = topk(similarity)  # [batch, k]
```

#### 🔗 **Stage 2: Bundle Activation** 
```python
# Get selected knowledge
selected_knowledge = embeddings[top_k_nodes]  # [batch, k, dim]

# Propagate through connected concepts
connected_concepts = adjacency_matrix @ selected_knowledge
enhanced_knowledge = selected_knowledge + α * connected_concepts
```

#### 🧠 **Stage 3: Neural Reasoning**
```python
# Apply neural processing to activated knowledge
reasoned_output = activation_network(enhanced_knowledge)  # [batch, k, dim]

# Weight by relevance and aggregate
weighted_sum = Σ(reasoned_output * attention_weights)  # [batch, dim]
```

#### 📤 **Stage 4: Knowledge Integration**
```python
# Combine with original input
enhanced_output = input_vector + weighted_sum  # [batch, dim]
final_output = output_projection(enhanced_output)

# Generate confidence score
confidence = sigmoid(confidence_network(final_output))
```

#### 🌱 **Stage 5: Self-Learning**
```python
# Decide if new knowledge should be created
if confidence > threshold and is_novel(input_vector):
    new_node = create_knowledge_node(input_vector)
    connect_to_relevant_bundles(new_node)
```
