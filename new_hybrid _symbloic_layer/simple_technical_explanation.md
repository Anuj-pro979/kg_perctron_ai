# How HKET Works Internally - Simple Technical Explanation

## üß† The Big Picture: What This System Actually Does

Imagine you're reading a book and trying to remember everything. Your brain does two things:
1. **Remembers the "feeling" of words** (like how "happy" feels different from "sad")
2. **Connects ideas together** (like "rain ‚Üí umbrella ‚Üí staying dry")

HKET does exactly this, but for AI systems!

## üìä Step 1: Converting Text to Numbers (Embeddings)

### What Happens:
```python
# Input text: "The cat sat on the mat"
text = "The cat sat on the mat"

# System breaks it into pieces (tokens)
tokens = ["The", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", "mat"]

# Each token becomes a list of numbers (embedding)
embeddings = [
    [0.2, -0.1, 0.8, ...],  # "The"
    [0.5, 0.3, -0.2, ...],  # "cat" 
    [-0.1, 0.7, 0.4, ...],  # "sat"
    # ... more numbers
]
```

### Why Numbers?
- Computers can only work with numbers, not words
- Similar words get similar numbers
- "cat" and "dog" will have similar number patterns
- "happy" and "sad" will have different patterns

### The Magic: SentenceTransformer
```python
transformer = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embedding = transformer.encode("Hello world")
# Result: [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ... 768 numbers total]
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 2: Storing Knowledge (Two Storage Systems)

### Storage System 1: Neural Memory (Fast Search)
Think of this like a **super-fast filing cabinet** with numbered folders:

```python
# Create storage for 1000 pieces of knowledge
neural_storage = torch.zeros(1000, 768)  # 1000 slots, 768 numbers each

# Store a new piece of knowledge
def store_neural_knowledge(concept, embedding):
    slot_number = find_empty_slot()
    neural_storage[slot_number] = embedding
    mark_slot_as_used(slot_number)
```

**What it stores:**
- Raw number patterns (embeddings)
- Which slots are being used
- How often each knowledge piece is accessed

### Storage System 2: Symbolic Memory (Smart Connections)
Think of this like a **mind map** with bubbles and arrows:

```python
# Create a knowledge graph
knowledge_graph = nx.DiGraph()  # Directed graph (arrows have direction)

# Add concepts
knowledge_graph.add_node("cat", type="animal", confidence=0.9)
knowledge_graph.add_node("mat", type="object", confidence=0.8)

# Add connections
knowledge_graph.add_edge("cat", "mat", relation="sits_on", strength=0.7)
```

**What it stores:**
- Concept names and types
- Relationships between concepts
- How strong each relationship is

## üîç Step 3: Finding Related Knowledge (Retrieval)

### Neural Search: "Find Similar Feelings"
```python
def find_similar_neural(query_embedding, top_k=5):
    similarities = []
    
    # Compare query with all stored knowledge
    for i, stored_embedding in enumerate(neural_storage):
        if slot_is_used[i]:
            # Calculate similarity (cosine similarity)
            similarity = dot_product(query_embedding, stored_embedding) / (
                magnitude(query_embedding) * magnitude(stored_embedding)
            )
            similarities.append((i, similarity))
    
    # Return top 5 most similar
    return sorted(similarities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:top_k]
```

### Symbolic Search: "Follow the Connections"
```python
def find_symbolic_connections(concept, max_hops=2):
    connections = []
    visited = set()
    current_level = [concept]
    
    for hop in range(max_hops):
        next_level = []
        for node in current_level:
            # Find all connected concepts
            for neighbor in knowledge_graph.neighbors(node):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    relationship = knowledge_graph[node][neighbor]
                    connections.append({
                        'from': node,
                        'to': neighbor,
                        'relation': relationship['relation'],
                        'strength': relationship['strength'],
                        'distance': hop + 1
                    })
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    next_level.append(neighbor)
        current_level = next_level
    
    return connections
```

## ü§ù Step 4: Combining Both Types of Knowledge

### The Fusion Process:
```python
def process_token_with_hybrid_knowledge(token_embedding):
    # Step 1: Find similar neural patterns
    neural_matches = find_similar_neural(token_embedding, top_k=3)
    
    # Step 2: For each neural match, find symbolic connections
    all_connections = []
    for match_idx, similarity in neural_matches:
        concept_name = get_concept_name(match_idx)
        connections = find_symbolic_connections(concept_name, max_hops=2)
        all_connections.extend(connections)
    
    # Step 3: Enhance the original token
    enhanced_token = combine_knowledge(
        original_token=token_embedding,
        neural_knowledge=[get_embedding(idx) for idx, _ in neural_matches],
        symbolic_knowledge=all_connections,
        similarities=[sim for _, sim in neural_matches]
    )
    
    return enhanced_token
```

### The Attention Mechanism (How It Decides What's Important):
```python
def apply_attention(query, knowledge_embeddings, similarities):
    # Convert similarities to attention weights
    attention_weights = softmax(similarities)  # Makes them add up to 1.0
    
    # Create weighted combination
    enhanced_representation = sum(
        weight * knowledge 
        for weight, knowledge in zip(attention_weights, knowledge_embeddings)
    )
    
    return enhanced_representation
```

## üèóÔ∏è Step 5: Creating New Knowledge

### When to Create New Knowledge:
```python
def should_create_new_knowledge(token_embedding, existing_knowledge):
    # Find most similar existing knowledge
    max_similarity = find_max_similarity(token_embedding, existing_knowledge)
    
    # If not similar enough, it's something new!
    if max_similarity < 0.85:  # 85% similarity threshold
        return True
    return False
```

### How New Knowledge is Created:
```python
def create_new_knowledge(token_embedding, confidence_score):
    # Step 1: Store in neural memory
    slot_number = find_empty_neural_slot()
    neural_storage[slot_number] = token_embedding
    
    # Step 2: Create symbolic representation
    concept_name = f"concept_{timestamp}_{slot_number}"
    concept_type = classify_concept_type(token_embedding)
    
    knowledge_graph.add_node(
        concept_name,
        neural_slot=slot_number,
        concept_type=concept_type,
        confidence=confidence_score,
        creation_time=current_time()
    )
    
    # Step 3: Connect to related concepts
    similar_concepts = find_related_concepts(token_embedding)
    for related_concept in similar_concepts:
        if similarity > threshold:
            knowledge_graph.add_edge(
                concept_name, 
                related_concept, 
                relation="related_to",
                strength=similarity
            )
```

## üîÑ Step 6: The Learning Loop

### How the System Gets Smarter:
```python
def learning_loop(input_sequence):
    enhanced_tokens = []
    
    for token_embedding in input_sequence:
        # 1. Try to find existing knowledge
        neural_matches = find_similar_neural(token_embedding)
        symbolic_context = find_symbolic_connections_for_matches(neural_matches)
        
        # 2. Enhance the token using found knowledge
        enhanced_token = apply_hybrid_enhancement(
            token_embedding, neural_matches, symbolic_context
        )
        enhanced_tokens.append(enhanced_token)
        
        # 3. Decide if this token taught us something new
        confidence = calculate_confidence(neural_matches, symbolic_context)
        if confidence > learning_threshold:
            create_new_knowledge(token_embedding, confidence)
            update_usage_statistics(neural_matches)
    
    return enhanced_tokens
```

### Progressive Complexity (Getting Smarter Over Time):
```python
class LearningStages:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_stage = 1
        self.success_count = 0
        
        self.stage_configs = {
            1: {"max_chunks": 3, "retrieval_k": 3, "connection_hops": 1},
            2: {"max_chunks": 5, "retrieval_k": 5, "connection_hops": 2},
            3: {"max_chunks": 8, "retrieval_k": 7, "connection_hops": 3},
        }
    
    def maybe_advance_stage(self, success_rate):
        if success_rate > 0.85 and self.current_stage < 3:
            self.current_stage += 1
            print(f"üöÄ Leveled up to Stage {self.current_stage}!")
```

## üßÆ Step 7: The Math Behind Similarity

### Cosine Similarity (How We Measure "How Alike" Two Things Are):
```python
def cosine_similarity(vector1, vector2):
    # Calculate dot product (multiply corresponding numbers and add them up)
    dot_product = sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector1, vector2))
    
    # Calculate magnitudes (how "long" each vector is)
    magnitude1 = sqrt(sum(a * a for a in vector1))
    magnitude2 = sqrt(sum(b * b for b in vector2))
    
    # Cosine similarity = dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)
    similarity = dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)
    
    return similarity  # Result between -1 (opposite) and 1 (identical)
```

### Example:
```python
# Two similar concepts
cat_embedding = [0.5, 0.3, -0.2, 0.8]
dog_embedding = [0.6, 0.2, -0.1, 0.7]
similarity = cosine_similarity(cat_embedding, dog_embedding)
# Result: 0.92 (very similar!)

# Two different concepts  
cat_embedding = [0.5, 0.3, -0.2, 0.8]
car_embedding = [-0.3, -0.8, 0.9, -0.1]
similarity = cosine_similarity(cat_embedding, car_embedding)
# Result: 0.12 (not very similar)
```

## üéØ Step 8: Creative Reasoning

### How It Generates Multiple Solution Paths:
```python
def generate_creative_paths(start_concept, end_concept, num_paths=3):
    creative_paths = []
    
    for i in range(num_paths):
        path = []
        
        # Method 1: Neural interpolation (smooth transition between embeddings)
        start_embedding = get_embedding(start_concept)
        end_embedding = get_embedding(end_concept)
        
        for step in range(5):  # 5 intermediate steps
            # Calculate position between start and end
            alpha = step / 4  # 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0
            
            # Add some creative randomness
            creativity_factor = random_vector() * 0.1
            
            # Interpolate with creativity
            intermediate = (
                (1 - alpha) * start_embedding + 
                alpha * end_embedding + 
                creativity_factor
            )
            path.append(intermediate)
        
        # Method 2: Symbolic reasoning (logical steps)
        symbolic_chain = find_concept_chain(start_concept, end_concept)
        
        creative_paths.append({
            'neural_path': path,
            'symbolic_chain': symbolic_chain,
            'creativity_score': calculate_creativity_score(path, symbolic_chain)
        })
    
    return sorted(creative_paths, key=lambda x: x['creativity_score'], reverse=True)
```

## üìä Step 9: Memory Management

### Preventing Information Overload:
```python
def manage_memory():
    # If we're running out of space
    if neural_slots_used > (max_slots * 0.9):
        # Find rarely used knowledge
        usage_scores = [get_usage_count(i) for i in range(max_slots)]
        rarely_used = [i for i, score in enumerate(usage_scores) if score < threshold]
        
        # Remove the least useful knowledge
        for slot in rarely_used[:10]:  # Remove 10 least used
            neural_storage[slot] = zeros()
            mark_slot_as_empty(slot)
            remove_from_symbolic_graph(slot)
    
    # Clean up broken connections in symbolic graph
    remove_orphaned_nodes()
    merge_very_similar_concepts()
```

## üîç Step 10: The Complete Processing Flow

### What Happens When You Give It Text:
```python
def complete_processing_example(input_text):
    # Input: "The smart cat learned quickly"
    
    # Step 1: Convert to embeddings
    embeddings = transformer.encode_tokens(input_text)
    # Result: 4 vectors of 768 numbers each
    
    # Step 2: Process each token
    enhanced_embeddings = []
    for token_embedding in embeddings:
        
        # Step 2a: Search neural memory
        similar_memories = find_similar_neural(token_embedding)
        # Finds: [("cat", 0.89), ("smart", 0.76), ("animal", 0.65)]
        
        # Step 2b: Search symbolic connections
        connections = []
        for memory_name, similarity in similar_memories:
            connections.extend(find_symbolic_connections(memory_name))
        # Finds: cat ‚Üí animal, smart ‚Üí intelligent, cat ‚Üí learns_fast
        
        # Step 2c: Combine everything
        enhanced = combine_knowledge(token_embedding, similar_memories, connections)
        enhanced_embeddings.append(enhanced)
        
        # Step 2d: Learn something new?
        if is_novel_enough(enhanced, confidence_threshold):
            new_concept = create_knowledge_node(enhanced)
            connect_to_related_concepts(new_concept, connections)
    
    return enhanced_embeddings
```
